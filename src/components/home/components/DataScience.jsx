      <p>Thanks for visiting my Data Science site.</p>

        But what is a Data Scientist? Can they actually program? Aren't they
        more like old geezers who teach linear regressions on clean data at a
        propoganda{' '}

        </a>{' '}
        of higher education. Aren't they less tech savvy than 14 year old
        youtubers from India? Or is it a dork who can utilize various tools to
        find and communicate actionable insights hidden in data?
      </p>
      <p>
        Here is where I would like to show some of my other tools. There are
        complex data visualizations, interactions with databases, backend
        functionality, and typical data science projects all found on this site.
