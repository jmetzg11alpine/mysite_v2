        Thanks for visiting my portfolio site. This is were I can demonstrate
        some of my skill as a Data Scientist
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        But what is a Data Scientist? Is it an old geezer who teaches linear
        regression on clean data at a a propoganda institution of higher
        education while being less tech savy than a 14 year old youtuber from
        India? Or is it a dork who can utilize various tools to find and
        communicate actionable insights hidden in data?
      </p>

        this url
